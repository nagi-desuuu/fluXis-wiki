# Skinning

To begin skinning, go to Settings -> Appearance -> Open fluXis folder, or navigate to `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\fluXis\` and create a "Skins" folder.

There are 8 different sections that go into each skin. The json file should be located at the root folder of your skin, while all of the other sections should be in their respective folders.
